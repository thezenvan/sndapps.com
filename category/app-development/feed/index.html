								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Been a fan of Apple for long, have you? Now you want to venture in deep and to <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">develop</a> <a href="http://sndapps.com/category/ios/">iOS apps</a>. Learning to do it properly is a multi phase process. If you are beginner in the area of coding, you have to start from the scratch learning the <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">development tools</a> and the rules and guidelines. Apple is famous for its restrictions, so it’s good to know what is permissible and what is not before you start. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/smartphone-381237_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-469" src="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/smartphone-381237_640-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="smartphone-381237_640" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/smartphone-381237_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/smartphone-381237_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Development Environment</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IDE or Integrated Development Environment employed by Apple for <a href="http://sndapps.com/category/ios/">iOS apps</a> is Xcode. It is free to use and can be downloaded easily from Apple website. You can use Xcode to write the apps through its graphical interface. Swift programming language is the one you can use to <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">develop apps for iOS</a> 8 and it also is included in this interface. Even if you are not familiar with Swift, you can try Objective–C and other languages for programming <a href="http://sndapps.com/category/ios/">iOS apps</a>. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/imac-606765_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-470" src="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/imac-606765_640-300x199.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="imac-606765_640" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/imac-606765_640.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/imac-606765_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guidelines to follow:</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s app store has some serious specifications which you should abide if you want to develop <a href="http://sndapps.com/category/ios/">iOS apps</a> and put it in Apple store. The guidelines must be followed and try to follow them from the start of app <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">development process</a>. Otherwise, you may be wasting your precious time and energy for creating something that others won’t get a chance to see and enjoy as Apple may not allow it in their App store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review guidelines page in the apple store is the place to go for checking out the guidelines.  It has also listed the common reasons for rejecting apps. This list includes but is not limited to presence of advertisements, incomplete information, broken links or app crashes.  Many of Apple API’s also having their own guidelines to follow. Apple is very rigorous with their app review and even a slight deviation from the mentioned requirements and regulations will earn you a rejection. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completely explaining about the app <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">development process</a> of iOS is not a small task.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android apps are the biggest commodity on the smart phone market right now. <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">Android application development</a> is a good skill set if you want to earn a top job in the software industry. If you want to take your company or idea to the masses, then <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">developing an app</a> for this purpose suits you better than the traditional methods of marketing strategy. For this purpose, you can depend on yourself or <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">mobile apps development</a> companies. If you want to do it yourself, read on to find the different ways you can try for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/monitor-933392_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-463" src="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/monitor-933392_640-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="monitor-933392_640" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/monitor-933392_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/monitor-933392_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different methods of <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">android app development</a></span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can depend on the Official Android developer site. It contains everything you need for creation of your android app including the IDEs. It is up to date and since it is run by those people who actually maintain Android SDK, you can rest easy. If you are a beginner in this area, then you can make use of the training section provided here which is comprehensive and informative. Another important factor top note, it is free to use. </span></p>
<p>Else you can choose an IDE like Eclipse and do it all yourself. Start by learning Java and <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">android development</a>. Try to achieve mastery on the subject by practice. Design and create your app with different UI and choose XML to help you with that. So learn XML too before trying to code for your app. Go for tutorials or classes or study by yourself. Mind you, it takes significant amount of time to achieve the required mastery and to create an app you want in the way you dream of. So, try this when you have unlimited amount of time at your disposal. <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">App developing</a> requires perseverance and patience.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/code-647012_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-465" src="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/code-647012_640-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="code-647012_640" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/code-647012_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/code-647012_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Another way to do this is to depend on a <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">trustworthy app development company</a>. They have dedicated <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">app developers</a> who will devote significant energy towards your project and will work with you to make your app the way you want it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android is the trend right now. Being an open source OS and the millions of mobile apps it provides through Google play adds to its popularity.

Many people want to <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">develop android apps</a> but don’t have the knowledge to do how. <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">App development companies</a> will guide you through the mobile app development process. Want to know some app development tips… Read on. Continue reading to discover what you need to know to create awesome android apps.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/drawing-933207_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-458" src="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/drawing-933207_640-300x199.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="drawing-933207_640" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/drawing-933207_640.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/drawing-933207_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prerequisites – What you need to know?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to develop the next candy crush, don’t you? Then you must have at least some coding experience or you must know how to write some basic codes. Java experience is handy when you are trying to create an android app. It is easy to learn but difficult to master. So if you want your app to be made by you without any outside help, prepare to spend some serious hours learning this one. XML will help you with your UI design. You must also have some experience in development environments like Eclipse. But if you don’t have the mastery or time to spend on this, try mobile <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">apps development</a> companies which will <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">develop your apps </a>for you.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/programming-1009134_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-459" src="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/programming-1009134_640-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="programming-1009134_640" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/programming-1009134_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/programming-1009134_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Must know tips and tricks</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must follow the Android design guidelines. This will help you to keep up with the latest trends and also to know what to do and what not to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always listen to the user’s input. They are the ones you want to love your app. Pay attention to your reviews and also take note of the customer needs and try to provide them. This will make your app better and it will also take it higher in rankings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember to optimize your apps. People hate it when apps slow down their ‘supposedly smart ‘phones. Try to make it optimized in speed and size as they are the key constraints that will determine whether your users accept or avoid your app.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1039117_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-460" src="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1039117_640-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="1039117_640" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1039117_640.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1039117_640.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1039117_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
