Laugh Out Loud with Your Android!<br />
Laughing helps us to stay healthy- both bodily and mentally. Laughing is the purest outcome of the good feeling one feels inside the heart. But our busy schedule, hectic day to day life makes us so robotic that we scarcely laugh much in the course of life. While some people laugh as a daily exercise, some mark laughing as a manner out of the decorum. To make advanced human race laugh again her is this new <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.laughsounds">Laughing Soundboard App</a> designed by sndapps. This crazy app for android has complete laugh track of over 40 different laughing sounds.<br />
Now, Laughing is Easy!<br />
This <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.laughsounds">laughter app</a> plays various realistic <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.laughsounds">laughing sounds</a> where we can hear the cumulative laughter of a crowd, a male laughing, a female laughing and various other <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.laughsounds">laughing sounds</a> including a baby laughing. The laugh tracks contain ‘play and pause’ modes. This feature enables you to mix tracks: you can now play a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.laughsounds">laugh sound</a> track and create a combination with the other laugh tracks to create new, interesting laugh tracks. This funny app for android enables you to experiment with maximum 5 laugh tracks running at the same time. This also helps in conserving your device memory.<br />
With this <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.laughsounds">laugh app</a>, you can now switch between tabbed layouts and single scroll layouts. This selection depends completely on your convenience. The app has been designed as a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.laughsounds">laughing soundboard</a> and is used in the stand up comedy shows or laughter events as the concluding effect of a joke. The tabbed layout is designed to be played at the time when one cannot look at the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.laughsounds">laugh soundboard</a>. Hence this layout has more of a static structure. On the other hand, the single scroll layout offers you an easy availability of all the laugh tracks right when you need it. Here one is not required to switch tabs. Both the layouts are very easy to use- it’s just the situation that matters. &amp; layouts switching is also easy and can be done whenever required.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android apps are the biggest commodity on the smart phone market right now. <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">Android application development</a> is a good skill set if you want to earn a top job in the software industry. If you want to take your company or idea to the masses, then <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">developing an app</a> for this purpose suits you better than the traditional methods of marketing strategy. For this purpose, you can depend on yourself or <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">mobile apps development</a> companies. If you want to do it yourself, read on to find the different ways you can try for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/monitor-933392_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-463" src="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/monitor-933392_640-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="monitor-933392_640" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/monitor-933392_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/monitor-933392_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different methods of <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">android app development</a></span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can depend on the Official Android developer site. It contains everything you need for creation of your android app including the IDEs. It is up to date and since it is run by those people who actually maintain Android SDK, you can rest easy. If you are a beginner in this area, then you can make use of the training section provided here which is comprehensive and informative. Another important factor top note, it is free to use. </span></p>
<p>Else you can choose an IDE like Eclipse and do it all yourself. Start by learning Java and <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">android development</a>. Try to achieve mastery on the subject by practice. Design and create your app with different UI and choose XML to help you with that. So learn XML too before trying to code for your app. Go for tutorials or classes or study by yourself. Mind you, it takes significant amount of time to achieve the required mastery and to create an app you want in the way you dream of. So, try this when you have unlimited amount of time at your disposal. <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">App developing</a> requires perseverance and patience.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/code-647012_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-465" src="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/code-647012_640-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="code-647012_640" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/code-647012_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/code-647012_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Another way to do this is to depend on a <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">trustworthy app development company</a>. They have dedicated <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">app developers</a> who will devote significant energy towards your project and will work with you to make your app the way you want it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you decided which method to choose? First one will teach you and let you make your app at your own pace. Second one requires you to spend considerable amount of time and energy for the output. Third method is the easiest method and will provide you with a stellar output as it created by professionals. Try </span><a href="http://sndapps.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://sndapps.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the creation of your next app. It is easy, quick and you have the guarantee of professionals.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/drawing-933207_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-458" src="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/drawing-933207_640-300x199.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="drawing-933207_640" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/drawing-933207_640.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/drawing-933207_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prerequisites – What you need to know?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to develop the next candy crush, don’t you? Then you must have at least some coding experience or you must know how to write some basic codes. Java experience is handy when you are trying to create an android app. It is easy to learn but difficult to master. So if you want your app to be made by you without any outside help, prepare to spend some serious hours learning this one. XML will help you with your UI design. You must also have some experience in development environments like Eclipse. But if you don’t have the mastery or time to spend on this, try mobile <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">apps development</a> companies which will <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">develop your apps </a>for you.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/programming-1009134_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-459" src="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/programming-1009134_640-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="programming-1009134_640" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/programming-1009134_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/programming-1009134_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Must know tips and tricks</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must follow the Android design guidelines. This will help you to keep up with the latest trends and also to know what to do and what not to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always listen to the user’s input. They are the ones you want to love your app. Pay attention to your reviews and also take note of the customer needs and try to provide them. This will make your app better and it will also take it higher in rankings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember to optimize your apps. People hate it when apps slow down their ‘supposedly smart ‘phones. Try to make it optimized in speed and size as they are the key constraints that will determine whether your users accept or avoid your app.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1039117_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-460" src="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1039117_640-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="1039117_640" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1039117_640.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1039117_640.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1039117_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So now that you know about <a href="http://sndapps.com/want-to-develop-an-app/">android development</a> and its prerequisites, you may decide to do either one of the two things.
