								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look around, you will find tons of different puzzle games out there. Most of them are very intriguing in nature and are great for the purpose of passing some time. One such puzzle game is the brand new <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.puppypuzzle">Dog and Puppy Puzzle Game App</a> released for Android platforms worldwide. On the surface, it is a pretty standard app but one that is extremely addictive in nature.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/beagle-puppy-2681_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-591" src="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/beagle-puppy-2681_640-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="beagle-puppy-2681_640" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/beagle-puppy-2681_640.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/beagle-puppy-2681_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><b>Design</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned before, you will find tons of puzzle games out there in the market. What makes this one so special then? Well, basically it is a </span><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.puppypuzzle">Puppy Puzzle Game</a>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means all the in-game designs are based around colourful and cute looking puppies. And who doesn&#8217;t like puppies? Almost everyone, of any age, is a sucker for cute looking puppies. This app is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking for a good </span><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.puppypuzzle">free puzzle game</a>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">this app is suited for you. However, as far as the game design and artwork is concerned, it is pretty obvious that the game is marketed towards little children and girls. After all, they are most likely to play such a puzzle based </span><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.puppypuzzle">puppy game</a>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">That does not mean that no one else can enjoy it.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dog-55206_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-483" src="https://i1.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dog-55206_640-199x300.jpg?resize=199%2C300" alt="dog-55206_640" width="199" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dog-55206_640.jpg?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dog-55206_640.jpg?w=425&amp;ssl=1 425w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Gameplay</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as the game itself is concerned, it basically involves matching 3 similarly coloured dog heads together so that they can be eliminated from the whole set of coloured dog heads. Your objective is to eventually remove all the dog heads in similar fashion. While it is a simple </span><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.puppypuzzle">free puzzle game</a>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is extremely addictive as well, and you may find yourself playing it for hours at a stretch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s more, about this app is that it is one of those </span><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.puppypuzzle">puzzle free games</a> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">which requires no money to use. So if you like to </span><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.puppypuzzle">play free puzzle games</a>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">then this is the app for you. You can also share your high scores across different social media sites as well.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever wanted an app that would allow you to mimic the sounds of different types of dogs? Well, there are plenty of them out there in the market to be fair. However, there is also an app that allows you to use the different dog sounds as per your liking and tunes them to different pitches. That app is called the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dog, and Puppy Barking Sounds app, and it is available in the Google Play Store. It is basically a </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.dogpiano"><b>dog piano </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.dogpiano">application</a>.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dog-926725_640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-485" src="https://i0.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dog-926725_640-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="dog-926725_640" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dog-926725_640.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/sndapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dog-926725_640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><b>About the app</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have ever wanted to manipulate the </span><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.dogpiano">sound of dog barking</a>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">there has never been an app as suitable as this for you. It has all the different </span><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.dogpiano">sounds of dogs barking</a> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">stored in it which you can use for your will. And yes, it is a pretty goofy app, but that&#8217;s the point. This is something made just for the fun of it and is not meant to be taken seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned before, it harnesses all the </span><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.dogpiano">sounds for dogs</a> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the form of a virtual piano which you can then use to produce different dog sounds. The piano pad allows you to produce these sounds in different pitches giving a flavor to all the keys present. And to fair, each of the stored recordings </span><b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sndapps.dogpiano">sounds dogs</a> like</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and realistic.</span></p>
